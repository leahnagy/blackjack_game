# Project Proposal
## Python and Math Fundamentals

### Game Selection
For this project, I have chosen to implement a Blackjack game in Python. 

### Exploration 
Some interesting questions I would like to explore are:
1. Which strategy, "conventional" or "heavy_hitter" produced more wins?
2. Add a "soft_hitter" strategy where the player only hits if the score <= 10. How does this compare to the other two strategies?

### MVP Goals
My MVP will be one hand of Blackjack that returns both the player's and dealer's scores and displays the winner of the hand.

### Most Challenging
The most challenging aspect of the game for me will be coding the gameplay.
