### Description


### Design
The project consists of an automatic Blackjack game that includes setting up a new game, playing the game, stopping the game, and displaying the results. Three separate strategies will be explored - a conventional strategy (hit when score is less than 16), a heavy hitting strategy (hit when score is less than 18), and a safe strategy (hit only when score is less than 11).

### Data
After playing 10,000 complete rounds of Blackjack per strategy, the results will be organized into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis and interpretation.

### Algorithms
1. Developed code that met the specifactions for each function.
2. All code passed the tests provided within the starter code.
3. Processed the data using Pandas.
4. Created visualizations using matplotlib to analyze the results.

### Tools
The following tools were used in this project:
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib

### Communication
Along with presenting my project to my colleagues, the entire project will be uploaded to my GitHub profile.
